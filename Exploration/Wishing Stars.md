===Wishing Stars===
'''[[Wishing Star|Wishing Stars]]''' are shooting stars that have fallen from the sky, leaving a trail behind them before crashing into the ground.

The explosion they generate on crash does not grief or deal damage, but leaves a [[File:px64_Wishing Star.png|24px|link=Wishing Star]][[Wishing Star]] behind for you to collect.
