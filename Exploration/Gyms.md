===Gyms [[File:px64_Gym Sign.png|32px|link=]]===
'''[[Gyms]]''' are structures you may know very well if you played the original Pokemon games. They come in many different variants, each characterized by one or two [[types]] and containing a certain amount of [[Npc Trainer|Gym Members]] that will block the passage to the [[Gym Leader|Leader]].<br>
Gyms have a chance to spawn near [[Towns|villages]], and their [[type]] can be completely unrelated to the biome the village is in.

The [[Gym Leader|Leaders]] will be awaiting for your challenge in the deepest spot of the gym, awarding you with a [[File:px64_Boulder Badge.png|24px|link=Badges/Ribbons]][[Badges/Ribbons|badge]] on defeat.
