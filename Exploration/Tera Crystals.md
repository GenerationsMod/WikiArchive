===Tera Crystals===

'''[[Tera Crystal|Tera Crystals]]''', similarly to [[Dynamax Energy Beams]], can be spotted easily thanks to their large beams of light, but they are much more common to find and their lights are fainter and not as visible.

Tera Crystals are required to charge your [[File:px64_Tera Orb.png|24px|link=Tera Orb]][[Tera Orb]] after use. Interact with them to fully recharge your [[Tera Orb|Orb]] and unlock the [[Terastal|Terastal phenomenon]] for another [[battle]].
