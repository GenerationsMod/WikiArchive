Have you ever wished to defend a village from the attack of an evil team, or battle Giovanni and show them who is the real strongest in town? Now you can!<br>
Generations replaces those pesky [https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Raid Pillager Raids] with its own equally pesky Rainbow Rocket Raids. These dangerous raids will eventually occur near [[Town|villages]], and will see a number of members of an evil team appear to attack the [[Villagers]]. Their main target is to steal all of the Villagers' [[Pokemon]] and their valuable cache of loot!<br>
Take your friends and engage the hoarders in [[battle]] to defend the village from the evildoing of the Team Rocket, Galactic, Magma- all of them!

During a raid, you will be encountering:
* [[RRR#Grunts|Grunts]]
** The weakest of the bunch, quite easy to defeat
* [[RRR#Agents|Agents]]
** Can put up a challenge
* [[Mega Evolution|Mega Pokemon]]
** They're on a rampage- defeat them to obtain [[File:px64_Charizardite_X.png|24px|link=Mega Stones]][[Mega Stones]]
* [[RRR#Admins|Admins]]
** Quite difficult
* [[RRR#Leader|Leader]]
** Prestigious battle veterans, beware!
<br>
Just like [https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Raid Pillager Raids], Rainbow Rocket Raids consist of 3 different difficulties and a different amount of enemies can spawn for each difficulty, as well as more waves.<br>
Successfully defending your [[Villagers]] from a Rainbow Rocket Raid will grant you a number of [[File:px64_Discount Coupon.png|24px|link=Discount Coupon]][[Discount Coupon|Discount Coupons]], as well as the rich loot each member drops.
