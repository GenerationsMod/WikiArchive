====Villagers====
:''Main article: [[Villagers]]''
As mentioned above, all Minecraft {{mclink|villagers}} are replaced with original Generations [[villagers]].<br>
Interestingly, these new villagers have quite the sweet tooth and have no interest in [[File:px64_Emerald.png|24px|link=https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Emerald]]{{mclink|Emeralds}}, they only look for [[File:px64_Normal Candy.png|24px|link=Type Candies]][[Type Candies]], a strange [[candy]] that has a chance to be dropped by any captured, defeated or released [[Pokemon]].

Generations villagers have a similar behavior to the standard ones, but cannot be [https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Villager#Curing cured] if transformed in [https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Zombie_Villager Zombie villager].<br>
They also have the unusual ability to be captured and transported into a [[File:px64_Cherish Ball.png|24px|link=Cherish Ball]][[Cherish Ball]], allowing you to move them easily and trade them with friends.

Villagers start off selling a small assortment of [[items]], generally the cheapest bunch. The more you purchase from a villager, the more (and rarer) items they begin to offer for trade. Level up your villagers by forming a friendship of frequent trades!<br>
Their leveling is locked initially, gift them a [[File:px64_Sweet Heart.png|24px|link=Sweet Heart]][[Sweet Heart]] or buy out their stock to befriend them.
