'''[[Space Time Distortion|Space Time Distortions]]''' are events that may occur randomly in the wild. They can be quite easily spotted thanks to their unique appearance as large black/purple spherical orbs.<br>
Unique [[items]], extinct and futuristic [[Pokemon]] may sporadically spawn in these space-time rifts, but will not last for long, despawning along the distortion once it eventually fizzles down and disappears.

[[File:px64_000-redblue.png|24px|link=MissingNo]][[MissingNo]] rarely and exclusively spawns in Distortions.
