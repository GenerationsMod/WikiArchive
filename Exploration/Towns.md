'''[[Towns]]''', or '''Generations Villages''', are enhanced Minecraft {{mclink|villages}} that have been tweaked to always include certain Generations original features.

Each Town is composed by a varying number of houses, but it will always have at least one [[Pokecenter]], one [[Pokemart]] and one [[Pokestop]]. Eventually you may also see a [[Gyms|gym]] spawn nearby, challenge it to be rewarded with a [[File:px64_Boulder Badge.png|24px|link=Badges/Ribbons]][[Badges/Ribbons|badge]].<br>
The standard {{mclink|villagers}} are replaced with Generations original [[villagers]], better themed to trade a variety of modded [[items]].
