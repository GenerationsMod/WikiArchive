===Hunger===
Every single Pokemon has a hidden hunger bar.<br>
This does not mean that a Pokemon can faint if not feeded properly, but they become happy and satified if their hunger bar is full. Once full, the Pokemon will refuse to eat any more [[Food]] until their hunger bar has been depleted completely.<br>
The Hunger bar is a Generations feature and has noting to do with [[File:px64_877.png|32px|link=Morpeko]][[Morpeko]] [[Pokemon Forms|forms]].

An hungry Pokemon requires {{i|Carrot|link=Food}}[[Food]] to be satisfied, Pokemon food is anything a player can eat with a bunch of extra [[items]]. [[Food]] is primarly used in [[breeding]], as full Pokemon breed faster than hungry Pokemon, however it is also possible to feed a Pokemon you own by interacting with it; full Pokemon have a chance to [[Relearners|remember]] a [[moves|move]] it forgot or learn a new move from their [[Move Tutors|tutor]] movepool.

Even if Pokemon are strangely attracted by {{i|Rare Candy}}[[Rare Candy|Rare Candies]], it is not one of their favourite foods.
