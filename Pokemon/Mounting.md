===Mounting===
:''Main article: [[Mounting]]''
Quite a few Pokemon, tipically the bigger ones, can also be ridden by the player. Not all Mounts are the same, they vary in speed, manovrability and visibility and are often limited to one terrain, but they are the most reliable way to move around the Pokemon world.

They come in 3 variants, depending on their preferred terrain:
* [[Mounting#Land Mounts|Land Mounts]], they are most useful on land, moving at considerable speed when ridden.
* [[Mounting#Water Mounts|Water Mounts]], they are most useful in water, allowing a player go underwater without suffocating.
* [[Mounting#Flying Mounts|Flying Mounts]], they are most useful in the sky, letting a player fly on them and reach Pokemon at unreachable altitudes.
