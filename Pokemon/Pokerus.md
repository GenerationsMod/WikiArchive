The '''Pokerus''', is a virus that may infect your [[Pokemon]] after any [[battle]], showing as a beneficial [[Status Conditions|Status Condition]] than cannot be cured by an [[File:px64_Healer.png|24px|link=Healer]][[Healer]].<br>
If any [[Pokemon]] in the player's [[party]] is infected, at the end of each battle the Pokerus will have a boosted chance to spread among other Pokemon in adjactent slots.

A [[Pokemon]] infected with Pokerus gains double the [[Effort Values]] from battling, however the EVs gained through [[Effort_Values#Items|Ev-enhancing medicines]] (such as [[Vitamins]]) will not be doubled. This status condition can be stacked with other [[Effort_Values#Power Items|Ev-training items]] (such as the [[Power Bracer]]).

=== Infection [[File:Pokerus infected.png|24px|link=]] ===
[[File:Summary-Pokerus infected.png|200px|right|thumb|Summary screen of an infected Pokemon, icon in the top-right corner.]]
A [[Pokemon]] has a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>21,845</sub> chance of '''getting infected''' by Pokérus after a battle with any wild Pokemon.<br>
An infected [[Pokemon]] also has a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>20,000</sub> chance to spread the infection to another Pokemon in the player's [[party]] after each battle. It is only possible to spread the virus between [[Pokemon]] in adjacent slots of the party, and only if they have never had Pokerus before.

A message reading <code>Your Pokémon ''<Pokemon name>'' has caught the Pokérus!</code> will be displayed in chat when one of your Pokemon is infected, and the Infected icon [[File:Pokerus infected.png|24px|link=]] will appear in the Pokemon [[Summary]].

=== Cure [[File:Pokerus cured.png|24px|link=]] ===
[[File:Summary-Pokerus cured.png|200px|thumb|right|Summary screen of a cured Pokemon, icon in the top-right corner.]]
A Pokerus infection will inevitably proceed towards '''getting cured''', and so will happen in 1-4 ''real days'' from the moment of the infection. Once cured, the [[Pokemon]] will become immune to Pokerus, becoming unable to spread it to other [[Pokemon]], but it will keep the double [[EVs|EV]] gain forever.

A [[Pokemon]] will have a chance to be cured from Pokerus in a period that goes from 24 hours to 96 hours after the moment of [[#Infection|Infection]]. This process cannot be stopped in any way, however it is possible to temporarily pause the cure by putting the infected Pokemon in the [[PC]].
 
A message reading <code>''<Pokemon name>'' gained 5 levels for being cured of Pokérus!</code> will be displayed in chat when the [[Pokemon]] is cured, as a consequence the Pokemon will gain 5 levels and the Cured icon [[File:Pokerus cured.png|24px|link=]] will replace the Infected icon [[File:Pokerus infected.png|24px|link=]] in the Pokemon [[Summary]].
