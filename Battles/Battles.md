Generations replicates the turn-based '''Battle system''' we all learned to love in the [https://www.pokemon.com/ Original games].

A '''Battle''' is a form of competition between [[Pokemon]], aimed at misuring their strenght. It can be usually started in 3 ways:
* by pressing '''R''' key, you will throw a Pokemon of your [[party]] out of the [[Poke Balls|ball]]. If the thrown ball hits a Pokemon, a [[NPC Trainer]] or a different player, you will engage them in battle.
* if attacked by an aggressive Pokemon. Wild Pokemon are usually unfriendly to trainers, some will run away at your passage while others will try to engage you in battle! Aggressive Pokemon follow you and other Pokemon around, trying to get in contact with their opponent and engage them in battle.
* if a particular type of [[File:px64_NPC Editor.png|24px|link=NPC Trainer]][[Trainer]] sees you. By walking in front of a NPC Trainer setted on "Engage" mode the player will be automatically engaged in battle.
Tipically, the first Pokemon to be sent out when you are engaged in battle will be the one in the ''1st slot'' of your [[party]].

Every battle involving at least one player can be '''spectated''' by pressing the '''Y''' key while pointing at the trainer. Spectators cannot interact with a battle in any way, but they can adjust their camera and have a real-time log of every move and action the battlers are taking.


While in battle, a Trainer is tasked to choose an action to perform each turn, this includes:
:- '''[[#Fight|Fight]]''', to select a move that will be used in that turn
:- '''[[#Bag|Bag]]''', to select an [[Items|item]] that may [[Medicines|heal]] or [[Battle Items|strenghten]] your Pokemon, or try to [[Poke Balls|catch]] the opposing Pokemon
:- '''[[#Party|Party]]''', to select a [[Pokemon]] from your [[party]] that will switch in place of the current one
:- '''[[#Run|Run]]''', to run away from the battle
Battles exist in many [[#Battle_Variants|variants]], with subtle and evident differences that affect your approach on them.<br>
The default and most common Pokemon battle is the one-on-one battle, where one Pokemon fights one foe at a time using the 4 known [[moves]] with the objective of dealing damage and defeat the opponent or all of the opponent's [[party]].<br>
Defeated Pokemon faint, returning to the trainer's [[Poke Balls|pokeball]] or, if wild encounters, despawning. If all the player's [[party]] is defeated, they will be forced out of battle and will not be able to join another battle until at least one member has its health restored.

Independently from the type of battle, all Pokemon drop ''Minecraft'' {{mclink|xp}}, Pokemon [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Experience xp] and a number of [[Effort Values|EVs]] on defeat.
