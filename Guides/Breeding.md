===Breeding===
'''[[Breeding]]''' is simple and intuitive for all players, indipendently from their knowledge of the Pokemon brand and games.<br>
While still offering all the core features introduced in the core games, the actual Generations breeding is a simple mechanic:
* Craft a [[File:px64_Ranch Block.png|24px|link=Ranch Block]][[Ranch Block]] and place it on ground
* Place (right-click) any [[Pokemon]] you wish to [[Breeding|breed]] into the [[File:px64_Ranch Block.png|24px|link=Ranch Block]][[Ranch Block]]
* Wait some time, the Pokemon will slowly grow accustomed to each other and eventually generate an [[File:px64_Pokemon Egg.png|24px|link=Egg]][[Egg]]
**''Optional'': Add any [[Food]] into the [[Ranch Block]] to speed up the process
* Interact with the [[File:px64_Pokemon Egg.png|24px|link=Egg]][[Egg]] to retrieve it
* Add the [[Egg]] to your [[party]] and walk around the world, after a certain number of steps it will start to crack and finally hatch
