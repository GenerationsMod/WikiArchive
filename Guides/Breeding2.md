'''Breeding''' is a process where two [[Pokemon]] reproduce, resulting in an [[Egg]].<br>
This process continues even if the {{mclink|chunk}} is unloaded.<br>
To have a more complete idea on how Breeding works in [https://generations.gg/ Generations], it is suggested to also check these pages:

====Exceptions====
To successfully generate an offspring, it is usually required to breed two [[Pokemon]] of opposite genders that share the same [[Egg Groups|Egg Group]], but there can be some exceptions to this rule:<br>

=How to breed=
[[File:Daycare-image.png|right|thumb|A Breeding area in Generations can be decorated however you want!]]
In order for two [[Pokemon]] to breed, they must be put inside of a[[File:Ranch Block.png|32px|link=Ranch Block]][[Ranch Block]].
{{Grid/Crafting Table
|B1=Flower Pot|B2=Pc|B3=Piston
|Output=Ranch Block|OA=}}
<br>
By right-clicking a placed [[Ranch Block]] it is possible to open its Interface and select up to 6 [[Pokemon]] to put in the breeder.<br>The selected Pokemon will start to wander around the 9x9 area and, if compatible for Breeding, they will slowly generate an [[Egg]].<br>Pokemon can only be selected from the player's [[PC]], not from the player's [[Party]].

If the [[Ranch Block]] is destroyed at any time during the Breeding process, all progress will be lost, but all the [[Ranch Upgrade|Ranch Upgrades]] used will be given back.<br>Any Pokemon inside the block will be returned to the player's [[PC]].


To generate an [[Egg]] it is recommended to also insert Food into the [[Ranch Block]] to speed up the breeding process and increase their Hunger.<br>

===Hunger & Speed===
Hunger Bars will display overtop a Pokemon to display how hungry they are.

If there is food in the [[Ranch Block]], the food will be automatically consumed when a Pokemon is at 10 Hunger Points or fewer. Alternatively, you may manually feed your Pokemon by clicking on them with food. [https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Food#Foods Food Point] value is based on normal values. For instance, an Apple will grant the Pokemon 4 Hunger Points, whereas Honey Bottle would grant 6 Hunger Points.

When there is food available in the [[Ranch Block]], the model will be updated to display feeding trays near it for an easy indication of whether your food supply has run dry or not.

Note: There are 2 Hunger Points per Hunger Bar. IE- 10 Hunger Points would be 5 Hunger Bars

===Egg===
After some time, an [[Egg]] will display in the Ranch Block to indicate the Breeding Process has completed. Simply interact with this Egg to claim it, which will then begin the breeding process for another egg to be produced after some time.

Your Pokemon will not lose Hunger when an Egg is sitting in a Ranch Block waiting to be claimed as the breeding process is then considered to be paused until the Egg is claimed.

You may stop the breeding process at any time by removing your Pokemon from the Ranch Block.

==Inheritance==
Parents can pass on several traits that they possess to their offspring.
===Shiny===
'''[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Shiny_Pok%C3%A9mon Shininess]''' cannot be passed down through Breeding, but it is possible to increase the chance of having a Shiny offspring using two methods:
* Breeding two [[Pokemon]] with differing [[Original Trainer|Original Trainers]] doubles (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2048</sub>) the chance.
* [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Masuda_method Masuda method] - Soon™

===IVs===
An offspring [[Pokemon]] will always inherit (by default) ''3'' of the ''12'' combined [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Individual_values IVs] of the parents.
:These IVs cannot overlap.<br>
(i.e. The offspring inherits HP, Attack and Defense IVs, each chosen from one of the parents. It is not possible to inherit HP IVs from both parents.)
:'''Note:''' ''If both parents hold the same type of Power item, either one of them will be randomly chosen to pass on the corresponding IV.''


The following [[HeldItems|Held items]] can be used to affect IVs inheritance:
{{Breeditemtop}}
{{Breeditem|Destiny Knot|&mdash;|Increases the inherited IVs from 3 to 5 (out of the total 12).<br>Cannot be stacked with itself.}}
{{Breeditem|Power Weight|HP|Forces the offspring to inherit the HP IV from the parent holding the item.<br>Can be stacked with the [[Destiny Knot]].}}
{{Breeditem|Power Bracer|Atk|Forces the offspring to inherit the Attack IV from the parent holding the item.<br>Can be stacked with the [[Destiny Knot]].}}
{{Breeditem|Power Belt|Def|Forces the offspring to inherit the Defense IV from the parent holding the item.<br>Can be stacked with the [[Destiny Knot]].}}
{{Breeditem|Power Lens|Sp. Atk|Forces the offspring to inherit the Special Attack IV from the parent holding the item.<br>Can be stacked with the [[Destiny Knot]].}}
{{Breeditem|Power Band|Sp. Def|Forces the offspring to inherit the Special Defense IV from the parent holding the item.<br>Can be stacked with the [[Destiny Knot]].}}
{{Breeditem|Power Anklet|Speed|Forces the offspring to inherit the Speed IV from the parent holding the item.<br>Can be stacked with the [[Destiny Knot]].}}
|}

===Poke Ball===
A parent [[Poke Balls|Poke Ball]] can be also inherited by the offspring.
* If two [[Pokemon]] of the '''same [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(species) specie]''' (male♂ and female♀) breed, the offspring will have the same chance to inherit either Ball. 
* If two [[Pokemon]] of '''different [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(species) species]''' breed, the offspring will always have the same Ball of the mother♀.
* If a male♂ [[Pokemon]] breeds with [[Ditto]], the offspring will always have the same Ball of the father.

::'''Note:''' ''[[Master Ball]] and [[Cherish Ball]] are the only [[Poke Balls|Balls]] that cannot be passed down by breeding.''

===Growth===
: ''Main article: [[Growth (stat)#Breeding|Growth]]''

===Nature===
The Nature can be inherited by giving one of the parents an [[File:Everstone.png|32px|link=Everstone]][[Everstone]] to hold.

:If both parents hold the [[Everstone]] the Nature will be chosen randomly between the two.

===Ability===
If a Mother ♀ is present, the Father ♂ has no bearing on the inherited Ability.

For '''Normal Abilities''':
* The mother ♀ has an 80% chance of passing her Ability to her offspring.
* The father ♂ (also applies to gender-unknown Pokemon) has 80% chance to pass down his Ability to his offspring, if bred with [[Ditto]].
For '''Hidden Abilities''':
* The mother ♀ has a 60% chance of passing her Hidden Ability to her offspring.
* The father ♂ (also applies to gender-unknown Pokemon) has 60% chance to pass down his Hidden Ability to his offspring, but only if bred with [[Ditto]].
*:They cannot pass down a Hidden Ability when bred with any Pokemon other than [[Ditto]].

Ditto's Ability is always irrelevant to inheritance.<br>
If an [[Egg]] does not inherit its Ability from a parent, it can only be born with one of its non-Hidden Abilities. The {{frac|150}} chance of obtaining a Hidden Ability is not present when breeding.
:'''Note:''' ''Usually Event Abilities make a Pokemon unable to breed.''

===Egg Moves===
By default, the offspring [[Pokemon]] starts with any moves that it learns at level 1, but it is possible to let it start with more moves.

Some moves, defined '''Egg Moves''', can only be obtained by a [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(species) specie] through breeding:
* If both parents know a move that the offspring can learn via leveling up, the Pokemon will inherit that move.
* If the father♂ or the mother♀ knows any specific Egg Moves that the offspring can learn, the offspring will inherit the move.
*::(''Refer to each specific [[Pokemon|Pokemon page]] for a list of the possible Egg Moves'')
* If a [[Pikachu]]/[[Raichu]] is holding a [[File:Light Ball.png|32px|link=Light Ball]][[Light Ball]], a bred [[Pichu]] will know the move Volt Tackle.
If this would result in the offspring possessing more than four moves, the moves take priority in the order listed: 
#[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Volt_Tackle_(move) Volt Tackle], ''<sub>(only in [[Pichu]] case)</sub>'' 
#Mother's ''Egg Moves'', 
#Father's ''Egg Moves'', 
#Inherited level-up moves, 
#Offspring's default moveset.

===Held Items===
:''Main article: [[Breeding Items]]''
Items to be [[Held Items|held]] by one of the parents to affect certain aspects of the offspring [[Pokemon]].

===Forms===
Pokemon species with multiple forms behave strangely with Breeding, but it is often possible to pass down the [[Pokemon Forms|Form]].

Here are some exceptions to this rule:
* [[Mothim]], if bred with [[Ditto]], always hatches with a [[Burmy Plant Cloak|Plant Cloak]].
* [[Rotom]] always hatches into its normal form.
* [[Vivillon]]'s pattern is chosen randomly when hatching.
* [[Furfrou]] always hatches into its [[Furfrou Natural Trim|Natural Trim]].
* [[Sinistea]] always hatches into its [[Sinistea Phony Form|Phony Form]].

For [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Regional_form regional forms] (''Alolan/Galarian/Hisuian''), instead, the offspring is completely dependant on the parents:
* If they are both regional (''Alolan-Alolan, Galarian-Galarian'') the offspring will have a '''100% chance''' to be a regional form.
* If the parents are mixed (''Alolan-Normal, Galarian-Normal, etc'') the offspring will have a '''50% chance''' to be a regional form.
* If one of the parents is [[Ditto]], (''Alolan-Ditto, Galarian-Ditto'') the offspring will have a '''25% chance''' to be a regional form.
::'''Note:''' If an [[File:px64_Everstone.png|24px|link=Everstone]][[Everstone]] is [[Held Items|held]] by one of the parents ([[Ditto]] excluded) the offspring will have a '''100% chance''' to be the same form as that parent.
====Ability Breeding Regional Forms====
:''Main article: [[Breeding#Ability|Ability]]''

When breeding [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Regional_form regional forms], there is an extra process to pass down Abilities:
* A regional form Pokemon cannot pass down its ability/hidden ability if its offspring is not a regional Pokemon.
::(i.e. A [[Galarian Rapidash]] can only pass down its ability if the offspring is a [[Galarian Ponyta]])
* A normal form Pokemon cannot pass down its ability/hidden ability if its offspring is a regional Pokemon.
::(i.e. A [[Rapidash]] cannot pass down its ability if the offspring is a [[Galarian Ponyta]])

Other than that, it follows the [[Breeding#Ability|standard rules]].
