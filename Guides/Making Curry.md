===Making Curry===
Generations '''[[Curry]]''' making is mostly similar to the mechanic in the core series, but with some due differences.<br>
While all recipes and classes have been kept unchanged, the real cooking is handled through a customized [[Interface|UI]] and the Curry quality probability is determined by the number of entries you unlocked in the [[Curry Dex]]:
* Craft a [[File:px64_Cooking Pot.png|24px|link=Cooking Pot]][[Cooking Pot]]
* Obtain a [[Curry#Recipes|key ingredient]] and a bunch of [[File:px64_Cheri Berry.png|24px|link=Berries]][[Berries]]
* Place your desired ingredients into the [[Cooking Pot]] to cook your Curry!


The [[Curry Dex]] has a total of 151 possible entries, each unlocked by cooking a different [[Curry#Recipes|Recipe]]. Create them all to become a better cook and unlock all the Class benefits:
