===Duplicating TMs===
The '''[[TMs|TM]] Duplication''' process is expensive and can only be carried out a number of times a day:
* Craft and place down a [[File:px64_Disc_Machine.png|24px|link=Disc Machine]][[Disc Machine]]
* Interact (right-click) with the [[Disc Machine|Machine]] to smelt a number of [[Resources|ores]] into a [[File:px64_Copy Disc.png|24px|link=Copy Disc]][[Copy Disc]]
* Place down the [[File:px64_Tm_Machine.png|24px|link=TM Machine]][[TM Machine]]
* Insert the original [[File:px64_Tm Normal.png|24px|link=TMs]][[TMs|TM]], a [[Copy Disc]] and a certain amount of matching [[File:px64_Bug Candy.png|24px|link=Type Candies]][[Type Candies]] to start the duplication
* If a [[TMs|TM]] has been duplicated recently, the [[TM Machine]] will show a cooldown timer on its [[Interfaces|UI]], preventing the player for duplicating a second TM until it has expired
*:'''Note''': A duplicated TM cannot create any duplicates.
