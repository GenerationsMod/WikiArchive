[[File:Render Artisan Villager.png|left|96px|link=]]'''Villagers''' are a different kind of [[NPCs|NPC]].<br>
They replace default minecraft {{mclink|Villagers}} in the Generations [[Towns]] and can be moved easily by the use of {{i|Cherish Ball}}[[Cherish Ball|Cherish Balls]].

It is still possible to [https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Trading trade] with them, make them breed and become the village Hero by saving them from a [[Rainbow Rocket Raid|Raid]]. However they are not able to claim any of the default [https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Villager#Professions Minecraft Professions], and will only have access to Generations custom [[#Professions|Job-site Blocks]].

Villagers have five Career Levels (Tiers) that can be increased by trading, each requiring a specific amount of XP to be achieved. Their current career level is shown both on the villager belt and in its trading menu, the higher a Villager level is the more trades it will offer and the richer items will be taken from its pool.<br>
Before unlocking advanced career levels, you will have to befriend the villager. Villagers can be befriended by buying out their entire stock or by gifting them a {{i|Sweet Heart}}[[Sweet Heart]].
:'''Note''': Villagers are easy to anger, do not put too much competition in an enclosed area, or they will refuse to trade.


Generations villagers have no interest in [[File:Emerald.png|24px|link=https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Emerald]]{{mclink|Emeralds}}, they will only trade their stock for a number of [[Type Candies]], a tasty sweet infused with the power of [[Types]] that has a chance to be dropped by any caught, defeated or released [[Pokemon]].

== Spawn Locations ==
* [[Towns]]

== Interactions ==
Interacting with a Villager opens a trading menu where you are able to exchange a certain amount of [[Candy#Type-based_Candy|Type-based candies]] for one or more [[items]].<br>
They will run out of stock after the first purchase, and will only restock their inventory once per calendar day.

The amount of [[Candy#Type-based_Candy|candies]] required and the [[items|item]] given depend on the Villager [[#Professions|profession]] and career level; increase their level to obtain better trades!

===Breeding===
:''Main article: [https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Villager#Breeding Villager]''
Villager breeding is mostly unchanged:<br>
They also have a 1% chance to generate a baby Villager per purchase, if their Career Level is at least 3.

===Curing===
:''Main article: [https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Villager#Curing Villager]''
Generations Villagers cannot be cured or infected by {{mclink|Zombies}}.

===Raids===
:''Main article: [[Rainbow Rocket Raid|Raids]]''
Generations replaces the default raids with [[Rainbow Rocket Raid|Rainbow Rocket Raids]], a new event where you will be defending the [[Town|Village]] from the attack of an evil team.<br>
Horde after horde, defeat [[RRR#Grunts|Grunts]], [[RRR#Agents|Agents]], [[RRR#Admins|Admins]], [[RRR#Leader|Leader]], and even [[Mega Evolution|Mega Pokemon]] on rampage!

== Professions ==
All Villagers, except for the {{mclink|Nitwit}}, are able to learn a '''Profession''' by claiming a specific type of block, the '''Job-site Block'''. The villager's profession is indicated by its clothing as well as by the title at the top of its trading interface.<br>
Removal of a claimed Job-site block causes the owner to switch to another profession or become unemployed.

Indipendently from their profession, villagers always ask to be paid in [[File:Normal Candy.png|24px|link=Type Candies]][[Type Candies]] and can offer huge discounts if presented with a [[File:Discount Coupon.png|24px|link=Discount Coupon]][[Discount Coupon|Coupon]].<br>
The number and type of [[Type Candies|Candies]] requested for a trade usually increases with the increasing of the villager's Career level.
