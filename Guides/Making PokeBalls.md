===Making Poke Balls===
The '''[[Poke Balls]]''' have always been the core of the Pokemon experience, the most common way to capture wild [[Pokemon]] and transport them with you. However their crafting has always been annoying and unbalanced, so we reworked it to offer the best gameplay experience to players:
* Craft a [[File:px64_Crafting Kit.png|24px|link=Crafting Kit]][[Crafting Kit]]
* Obtain a number of [[File:px64_Tumblestone.png|24px|link=Resources]][[Resources|Tumblestone]] and [[File:px64_Red Apricorn.png|24px|link=Apricorns]][[Apricorns]], they come in many variants!
* Use (right-click) the [[File:px64_Crafting Kit.png|24px|link=Crafting Kit]][[Crafting Kit]] to access all available recipes 
* Craft your [[Poke Balls]] wherever you are whenever you want!


The [[Crafting Kit]] displays all available recipes in its [[Interfaces|UI]] while highlighting the [[Poke Balls]] you can craft with the [[Resources|Tumblestone]] and [[Apricorns]] you currently have in your {{mclink|inventory}}.
