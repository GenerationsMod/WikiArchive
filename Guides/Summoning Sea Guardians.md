{{Group-Sea Guardians}}
The '''[[Sea Guardians]]''' is a duo that can be obtained exclusively by [[Breeding]].

==Steps to obtain the Sea Guardians==
# Opposite to the Original Games, in Generations it is possible to breed two [[File:px64_132.png|32px|link=Ditto]][[Ditto]] to generate a random offspring
#* This offspring can be any non-[[Legendary Pokemon|Legendary]] [[Pokemon]] with other specific exceptions 
# However, there is a small chance (nearly <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1,000</sub>) to obtain a [[File:px64_Manaphy Egg.png|24px|link=Egg]][[Egg|Manaphy Egg]] or [[File:px64_Phione Egg.png|24px|link=Egg]][[Egg|Phione Egg]]
#* It is possible to take some additional steps to increase the chance to obtain both Pokemon:
#*# [[File:px64_489.png|32px|link=Phione]]'''[[Phione]]''': 100% chance by breeding [[File:px64_490.png|32px|link=Manaphy]][[Manaphy]] with [[Ditto]]
#*#:'''Note''': Each [[Manaphy]] can only produce one [[File:px64_Phione Egg.png|24px|link=Egg]][[Egg|Phione Egg]]
#*# [[File:px64_490.png|32px|link=Manaphy]]'''[[Manaphy]]''':
#*#* Double the chance of success by having both parents [[Held Items|hold]] a [[File:px64_Mystic Water.png|24px|link=Mystic Water]][[Mystic Water]]
#*#* 100% chance by having a parent [[Held Items|hold]] a [[File:px64_Blue Orb.png|24px|link=Blue Orb]][[Blue Orb]], the Orb is consumed on use
# Interact (right-click) with the [[Egg|Manaphy Egg]] to summon [[File:px64_490.png|32px|link=Manaphy]][[Manaphy]]

===Additional Notes===
:The [[File:px64_Manaphy Egg.png|24px|link=Egg]][[Egg|Manaphy Egg]] is consumed on use.
:A [[File:px64_490.png|32px|link=Manaphy]][[Manaphy]] can only successfully breed a single [[File:px64_489.png|32px|link=Phione]][[Phione]].
