Quite a few [[Pokemon]], tipically the bigger ones, support the ability to be ridden by a Trainer.<br>
In your journey you will also be able to unlock two special kinds of Pokemon, specifically dedicated to mounting: the [[Saddle Pokemon|Saddle Forms]] and the [[Celestial Flute|Celestial Mounts]]. They are fast, strong, easy to control and often come with an unique power or boost, however they are difficult to obtain and come with a number of limitations.

A Pokemon in your [[party]] can be mounted by interacting with it while {{tt|empty-handed|Not required, but recommended to avoid unwanted interactions.}}, once mounted they will immediately follow your orders and will be able to be moved and steered by using the [[Controls#Riding controls|Riding Controls]]. A Pokemon can be dismounted by {{mclink|sneaking}}, returning it to its [[File:px64_Poke Ball.png|24px|link=Poke Balls]][[Poke Balls|Poke Ball]], or by touching {{mclink|water}} with a Pokemon that cannot swim.<br>
They are technically subdivided in three macro categories:
* '''[[#Land Mounts|Land Mounts]]''', they are most useful on land, moving at considerable speed when ridden:
** The most basic type of Mounting, all ridable Pokemon can be used on solid ground, but only a restrict number is able to run at decent speed while on land. They all share the ability to move up 1 block tall surfaces without the need to jump.<br>Sporadic Land Mounts are also able to swim in water, however they do not stop the player from suffocating underwater.
* '''[[#Water Mounts|Water Mounts]]''', they are most useful in water, allowing a player go underwater without suffocating:
** Mounts able to swim fast in {{mclink|Water}}, they grant the player an immunity to suffocation. These Pokemon struggle to keep their balance when emerged, but they can keep a stable height while deep underwater.<br>Most Water Mounts become completely incapacitated on land.
* '''[[#Flying Mounts|Flying Mounts]]''', they are most useful in the sky, letting a player fly on them and reach Pokemon at unreachable altitudes:
** Mounts able to fly while ridden by the player, to let you reach Pokemon the [[Poke Balls|Poke Ball]] range cannot. By holding the '''Jump''' key they ascend to the sky, increasing their height the longer the key is pressed, let go of the key to slowly glide downwards to land.<br>Sporadic Flying Mounts are also able to swim in water, however they do not stop the player from suffocating underwater.


A few Pokemon are also able to be used on more than one terrain, keeping their pace nicely, but they will only give their best in their original environment.<br>
The walking speed of a Pokemon depends on many factors and may vary even between Pokemon of the same species, but their Base Speed stat can be used as a trustworthy indicator of their movement speed.
